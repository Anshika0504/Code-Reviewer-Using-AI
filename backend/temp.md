This function is minimally functional but lacks robustness and clarity. Here's a
review incorporating the guidelines:

**Issues:**

1. **Missing Parameters:** The function `sum()` is declared without parameters
(`a` and `b`). This will result in a `ReferenceError` when called because `a`
and `b` are undefined in the function's scope.

2. **Lack of Type Safety (JavaScript Specific):** JavaScript is dynamically
typed. While this offers flexibility, it can lead to unexpected behavior. Adding
type hinting (though not enforced in JavaScript) would improve readability and
help catch errors earlier.

3. **Lack of Error Handling:** The function doesn't handle cases where `a` or
`b` are not numbers (e.g., strings, null). This can lead to unexpected results
or runtime errors.

4. **Missing Documentation:** No comments explain the function's purpose or
usage.

**Improved Version:**

```javascript
/**
* Adds two numbers together.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b. Returns NaN if either input is not a
number.
* @throws {Error} If either input is not a number. (Optional - For stricter
error handling)
*/
function sum(a, b) {
//Stricter error handling (Optional - uncomment to enable)
// if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
// throw new Error('Both inputs must be numbers.');
// }

//More concise error handling (returns NaN if not a number)
return typeof a === 'number' && typeof b === 'number' ? a + b : NaN;

}

// Example usage
console.log(sum(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(sum(10, -2)); // Output: 8
console.log(sum("5",3)); // Output: NaN (or throws an error if stricter handling
is enabled)
console.log(sum(null, 5)); // Output: NaN (or throws an error if stricter
handling is enabled)

```

**Overall:**

The original function was very basic. The improved version addresses the
identified issues, making it more robust, readable, and maintainable. The
optional stricter error handling provides better control over invalid inputs.
Choosing between returning `NaN` or throwing an error depends on the context and
how the function's potential errors are handled in the rest of the application.
Returning `NaN` is generally preferred for simple cases as it avoids abrupt
termination. Throwing errors is preferred if it's crucial to halt execution on
erroneous input.
