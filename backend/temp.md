This code snippet has a few issues:

1. **Missing Parameters:** The function `sum()` is declared but doesn't define
any parameters `a` and `b`. This will result in a `ReferenceError` because `a`
and `b` are not defined within the function's scope.

2. **Implicit Global Variables (Bad Practice):** If you were to call this
function and pass values, JavaScript would implicitly create global variables
`a` and `b`, which is generally considered bad practice. It makes the code
harder to understand, maintain, and debug, especially in larger projects.

**Corrected Code:**

The corrected code explicitly defines the parameters:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

**Further Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Type Checking (Optional but Recommended):** For robustness, you might want
to add type checking, especially if this function is part of a larger
application. You could use TypeScript or add a check within the function itself:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
throw new Error('Both arguments must be numbers');
}
return a + b;
}
```

* **More Than Two Arguments (Consider a Rest Parameter):** If you anticipate
needing to sum more than two numbers, using a rest parameter (`...args`) offers
a more flexible and concise solution:

```javascript
function sum(...args) {
if (!args.every(Number.isFinite)) {
throw new Error('All arguments must be numbers');
}
return args.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
}

```

This version handles any number of numerical arguments. `Number.isFinite`
provides a more robust check for numbers than `typeof`.

* **Function Naming:** The name `sum` is appropriate and clear, so no changes
needed there.

In summary, while the original intent is clear, the corrected versions address
the critical errors and improve the robustness and flexibility of the code
significantly. Choose the version that best suits your needs and the complexity
of your application. For most cases, the version with the rest parameter is the
most versatile and maintainable.
